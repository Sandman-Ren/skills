## Workspace Structure

This is a multi-repo workspace. Here's how it's organized:

```
├── workspace.yaml      # manifest — source of truth for repos, worktrees, deps
├── .claude/
│   └── settings.json   # agent permissions (edit to customize)
├── repositories/       # repositories we're actively working on
├── docs/               # cross-repo design documents and specs
├── deps/               # dependency repos for reference and analysis
├── tasks/              # task assignments and coordination files
└── sketch/             # scratch space (gitignored, ephemeral)
```

## Conventions

### Worktree Rules
- **Do NOT switch branches in `repositories/{repoName}/main/`** — it is the worktree parent and anchors all other worktrees. Only work in directories under `worktrees/`.
- Each worktree is an independent working directory. Multiple agents can work on different worktrees simultaneously.

### Directory Usage
- **`docs/`** — For design decisions, specs, and ADRs that apply across repos. These outlive individual tasks.
- **`tasks/`** — For task descriptions, assignments, and status tracking between agents.
- **`sketch/`** — Free-form scratch space. Anything goes. It is gitignored and ephemeral.
- **`deps/`** — Read-only reference. Clone and analyze, but do not commit changes here unless explicitly coordinating upstream fixes.

### Permissions
- Agent permissions are configured in `.claude/settings.json`.
- Common read-only and build/test commands are pre-approved — no manual confirmation needed.
- Git write operations (commit, push, merge) require confirmation.
- Dangerous operations (rm -rf, sudo, force push) are blocked.
- `.env` and `.env.local` files are blocked from reading. `.env.example` is allowed.
- Edit `.claude/settings.json` to add project-specific rules.

### Agent Coordination
- Before starting work, check `tasks/` for assignments.
- Read `docs/` for context on design decisions.
- Use `sketch/` for prototyping before committing to a worktree.
- When finishing a task, update the relevant file in `tasks/`.
